# Laravel Internals

GitHub issues for Laravel internals discussion. These can include discussions regarding modifying existing Laravel behavior or proposing new features for the framework. However, if you are proposing a new feature, you should be willing to code the feature if possible.

Informal Laravel development discussion takes place on the `#internals` channel of [LaraChat](http://larachat.co/) and on the #laravel-dev Freenode IRC channel.
